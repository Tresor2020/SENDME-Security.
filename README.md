# SENDME Security Enhancements

## Overview
SENDME is a revolutionary peer-to-peer postal system that allows travelers to earn money by carrying extra kilos of items. To ensure trust and security, every user must verify their identity by uploading an ID or passport before using the app. The platform also incorporates multi-factor authentication (MFA), real-time tracking, and advanced fraud detection to safeguard transactions.

## Key Security Features
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Strengthens authentication security.
- **ID/Passport Verification**: Ensures trust by requiring identity verification.
- **Secure Transaction Validation**: Prevents fraudulent activities and unauthorized transactions.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Implements anomaly detection to identify suspicious activities.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Allows senders and recipients to track package location securely.
- **Encrypted Data Storage**: Protects user data and ensures compliance with security best practices.
